    <p>If $f(x)$ is a differentiable function, then its linear approximation at $x=a$ is
      $$
      f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
      $$
      But why? Why does this work? Understanding why this works is very closely tied to understanding how the definition for a derivative works. In fact, the fact that this linear approximation is the best possible way to approimate $f(x)$ near $f(a)$ with a line is a way that we could define the derivative! Let's unpack what this all means.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick note. If we write $\Delta x=x-a$, the we can rearrange this to say $f(a+\Delta x) \approx f(a)+f'(a)\Delta x$. This is sometimes used in applications to simplify expressions.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Firstly, the derivative of $f(x)$ is defined to be
      $$
      f'(a) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
      $$
      If take this and then we view the expression
      $$
      \epsilon(h)=f'(a)-\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
      $$
      as a function of $h$, then we must have that $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \epsilon(h) = 0$. That is, if $h$ is "small", then so is $\epsilon(h)$. We can rearrange this formula to get
      $$
      f(a+h)=f(a)+f'(a)h -h\epsilon(h).
      $$
      This should look a little familiar. In fact, if we put $x=a+h$ and plug this in then we get
      $$
      f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) - (x-a)\cdot\epsilon(x-a)
      $$
      Recall that if $x-a$ is small, then so is $\epsilon(x-a)$ is too, which means that their product is even smaller. In particular, it is smaller than the other terms, so we can write $f(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a) + (\textrm{ Very Small })$ which is to say that near $x=a$ (ie, $x-a$ is small) the function $f(x)$ is approxixmately equal to the line $f(x)+f'(a)(x-a)$. The existence of this function $\epsilon(h)$ whose limit at zero is zero is what makes this work. If the limit were something other than zero, then the term $(x-a)\epsilon(x-a)$ would be able to compete with the term $f'(a)(x-a)$ since they would then get small at similar rates and we couldn't say that $f(x)$ approximately equals a line. We'll see how this works in the next section.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p> Now let's see that the derivative is the unique slope $C$ to the line $L(x)=f(a)+C(x-a)$ so that $L(x)$ approximates $f(x)$ nead $x=a$ the best. This will be a little more technical. Note that $L(a)=f(a)$. If it exists, consider the value
      $$
      m = \lim_{x\rightarrow a} \frac{L(x)-f(x)}{x-a}
      $$
    If $m\ne 0$, then this means that $L(x)-f(x) -m\cdot (x-a) = E(x)$, where  the limit of $E(x)$ at $x=a$ is zero. This means that the line $$\overline{L}(x) = L(x)-m\cdot(x-a) = f(a) + (C-m)(x-a)$$ approximates $f(x)$ near $x=a$ better since the different between the two goes to zero faster around $x=a$. So if $L(x)$ is going to approximate $f(x)$ the best then we should have $m=0$. If, then $m=0$, we get that
    $$
    0 = \lim_{x\rightarrow a} \frac{L(x)-f(x)}{x-a} = C + \lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{f(a)-f(x)}{x-a}
    $$
    from which we get $C=\lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$, which is the definition of the derivative.
  </p>
  <p> So the derivative is defined as the slope of the line that best approximates $f(x)$ around the point of interest. The familiar limit formula is then an alternate, yet equivalent, expression of this.</p>
