  To understand relativity, and all the cool stuff like Black Holes and Gravitiational Waves, you really need to know what relativity is and why it is needed. And to know this, you need to understand a little bit of background in physics. In this article, we'll talk a little about the history leading up to Special Relativity and what Special Relaltivity says.
  <h3>Historical Context</h3>
  <p>In the late 1600s, Newton gave the first solid, complete mathematical description of the basic mechanics of motion. Using his framework, if you know the forces that act on an object, you could, in principle, figure out exactly what will happen to the object. This was codified in Newton's Laws, which are simple enough that their principles can be taught to students, but can be expressed robustly in terms of mathematics, allowing us to actually use them. This was very successful, and was used to describe many things, ranging from the motion of the planets to oscillatory motion of springs and more. Over the next ~200 years, his mechanics would be dissected and coelesse with other theories that say the same thing, but are more attractive mathematically, to form the field of Classical Mechanics. Classical Mechanics is the mathematical framework to describe the motion of objects, as motion is traditionally understood. Importantly, Classical Mechanics doesn't tell us  how forces act, or how they work, it just tells us what will happen once we know all the forces involved. </p>
  
  <p>
  Contrasting this, the theory of Electromagnetism was developed by people like Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell in the mid-1800s. This theory described the behavior and interaction of the electric and magnetic forces. If we know how electric charge is configured, and what its motion is, then we can use the theory of Electromagnetism to figure out what the resulting electromagnetic forces will be. This, together with Classical Mechanics, can be used to predict how charged particles will move. The theory of Electromagnetism tells us what the forces do, and Classical Mechanics tells us what the particles will do, and there is a kind of feedback between them (since the electromagentic field will  change based on how the particles move and vice versa).</p>
  <p>Electromagnetism is a great success and predicted many different things, in particular it gave us an understanding about the nature of light. Light is what happens when you try to find a solution to Maxwell's equations in the absence of any electric charge. The result of this is a wave in the electromagnetic fields. This is, essentially, a back-and-forth between the electic and magnetic fields that propegates itself through space.</p>
  
  <p>Both Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism are extremely powerful theories, with a lot of interesting physics, and math, going into them. Careers have been made, even today, by studying the physics behind these theories and by studying the math behind them. But there are a few issues when you try to mix them. Electromagnetism is supposed to tells us how the electric and magnetic forces and fields behave, and then we should be able to use Classical Mechanics to see how particles will move in the presence of these fields. But you can setup legitimate situations where the interaction between these two theories result in contradictory conclusions. These contradictions generally happen when you setup a theoretical experiement, and see what happens to the involved objects when you look at them without moving, and then look at it again while you're moving relative to the experiment. What happens is that the experiment does different things based on how fast you're moving when you look at it. Obviously this doesn't make much sense, as what happens is what happens, and it shouldn't depend on how fast you're going when you look at it.</p>
  
  <p> There were attempts to solve these problems, most notably with the Lumineferous Aether. This was the theory that there was a medium through which light propegated, like waves in the ocean propegate through water. Famously, this theory was proved wrong through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment">Michelson-Morely Experiment</a>, using Interferometers, experimental objects that come into play later in the theory of relativity. Overall, the mix of Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism predicts that there is a universal frame of rest for the entire universe, and that movement is always relative to this one particular frame. The Aether Theory was an attempt at replacing this absolute frame of reference with just a reference medium that light propegates through. The Michelson-Morely Experiment proved that both of these assertions were false. Light does not respect an absolute frame of reference, so there is no "absolute rest" in the universe, or an absolute medium that light propegates through.</p>
  
  <p>Where we're at at the end of the 1800s is with two really powerful theories, one of motion and one of electromagnetism, that do not combine. At least one of these theories needs to be modified to get rid of these contradictions</p>
  
  <h3>The Solution: Special Relativity</h3>
  <p> In 1905, Albert Einstein published three papers, each of which revolutionized three different fields in the process. In one, he used statistics to describe the motion of particles in a solution, essentially proving that atoms and molecules were a thing and that Thermodynamics could be described using statistics, validating the theory that Boltzmann had put forth (who would later commit suicide because he was ostricized for these theories, and never saw Einstein's paper). The second paper provided a mathematical framework for a certain quirk of light energizing electrons on sheets of metal, that showed that the way electrons absorbed energy was not continuous, but rather quantized. This was the first real look into Quantum Mechanics.</p>
  <p>Einstein's third paper solved the above problems resulting from the mix of Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism.
