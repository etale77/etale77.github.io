    The Riemann Zeta Function governs the behaviour of the primes and how they are distributed through Euler's Formula
    $$
    \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s} = \prod_{p}\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}
    $$
    which is valid for all complex numbers $s$ whose real part is larger than $1$. In general, however, this defines function that is meromorphic on the entire complex plane. This function has known zeros at ever negative even integer, $\zeta(-2n)=0$, and possible zeros in the region $0\leq \textrm{Re}(s)\leq 1$ but also a pole at $s=1$. The zeros get a lot of glory, due to the Riemann Hypothesis which says that the zeroes in the afformentioned region are actually all on the line $\textrm{Re}(s)=1/2$, but it is the pole that determines a lot of the properties of primes. This is what we will be interested in looking at. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In particular, we will be concerned with how the existence of this pole determines that there are infinitely many primes, that the connection with the Harmonic Series determines the rate at which the sum $\sum_p\frac{1}{p}$ diverges, and how this can give us a bound on the growth of primes. Additionally, we'll look at Merten's more refined look at this sum. Finally, we'll see how the poles and zeros explicitly determine the growth of primes, and how the pole is the main driving force and how the Riemann Hypothesis is really the hypothesis that the zeros don't mess things up too much.

    <h3>The Infinitude of Primes</h3>
    <p> The first thing that we can learn about primes from the pole of the Riemann Zeta Function is that there are infinitely many of them. As mentioned, for any $s$ whose real part is larger than $1$, we have Euler's Product Formula. In particular, we must have 
    $$
    \lim_{s\rightarrow 1^+}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s} = \lim_{s\rightarrow 1^+}\prod_{p}\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}
    $$
    At this point, it is tempting to just say that the left side of this equation must be infinity, since $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}=\infty$, but this makes the assumption that the infinite series is valid even in the limit. In other words, it assumes that we can switch the limits: $\lim_{s\rightarrow 1^+}\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{1}{n^s} = \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\lim_{s\rightarrow 1^+}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n^s}$, which isn't necessarily true. Though, it does turn out that we can do it in this case. In particular, we know that 
    $$
    \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n} = \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}
    $$
    Since the sum on the left is the harmonic series, it follows that the limit is infinity. We therefore have $\prod_p(1-p^{-1})^{-1}=\infty$ where the product is over all primes. Since each individual term is finite, the only way that this can be infinite is if there are infinitely many primes. We then have our first, basic, result that shows how the primes are goverend by this pole.

    <h3> The Divergence of the Sum of Reciprocal Primes</h3>
    <p>
    The above is fairly simple, and all we can do is conclude that there are infinitely many primes. If, however, we use the formula $\lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n} = \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}$ to figure out the rate at which these expressions diverge, we can learn a bit more explicit information about the distribution of primes. Note that the equality of these limits means that 
      $$
      \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n} = \prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}} + o(N)
      $$
      where $o(N)$ represents some function that goes to zero as $N$ goes to infinity. 
    </p>
    <p> The first thing to note is that $\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{1}{n}$ grows like $\log(N)$. This can be seen by comparing the sum to an integral of $\frac{1}{x}$. Explicitly this is expressed as $\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{1}{n} = \log(N)+O(1)$, which means that the difference between the sum and the log is bounded. This is a statement about the behavior of the zeta function as it approaches the pole. Given this neat asymptotic approximation for the partial sums in the harmonic series, we need to figure out an expression for the partial products in the prime expression. Combining this with the above means that
      $$
      \prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}} = \log(N) + O(1)
      $$
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards this end, we are going to take a logarithm so that we can turn this product into a sum. This looks like
      $$
      \log\left(\prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}\right) = -\sum_{p\leq N}\log(1-p^{-1})
      $$
      We can expand the logarithms as a power series and get
      $$
      \log\left(\prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}\right) = \sum_{p\leq N} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{p^{-k}}{k} = \sum_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{p} +\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}\sum_{p\leq N}\frac{p^{-k}}{k}
      $$
      The important thing about this is that the final double-sum converges as $N\rightarrow\infty$. In particular, we have that $\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}\frac{p^{-k}}{k}< \frac{1}{2p^2}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{p^k}$ from which we can extract a geometric series. This means that for every $p$ this term is bounded above by $\frac{1}{2p(p-1)}$. Summing over all $p\leq N$ is less than summing $\frac{1}{2n(n-1)}$ over all $n>1$ which is convergent and the bounds on this convergence are independent of what $N$ was. We can then conclude that
      $$
      \log\left(\prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}\right) = \sum_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{p} + O(1)
      $$
      And combining this with what we learned above, we can say that 
      $$
      \sum_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{p} = \log\log(N) + O(1)
      $$
      This shows that the growth of the series at the pole can help us determine how fast this particular sum of primes diverges. We can in fact do more. We can use this to get a statement about how the primes themselves grow
      </p>
    <h4>The Prime Counting Function</h4>
    <p> To do this, we consider the prime counting function $\pi(x)=\sum_{p\le x}1$, which is just the number of primes less than $x$. The previous result tells us how the sum $\sum_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{p}$ grows, so surely we can use it to figure out how the prime counting function grows. To do this, we invoke Partial Summation, which is a slightly modified version of Integration-by-Parts that mixes it with sums. This states that if $a_n$ is a sequence and $f(x)$ is a differentiable function and $A(x)=\sum_{n=1}^x a_n$, then
        $$
           \sum_{y\le n \le x}a_nf(n) = f(x)A(x) - f(y)A(y) - \int_y^x f'(t)A(t) dt  %'
        $$
      With the choice that $f(x)=x$ and $a_n=1/n$ when $n$ is prime and zero otherwise, we get that $\sum_{y\leq n\le x}a_nf(n) = \pi(x)-\pi(y)$ and that $A(x)=\sum_{p\e x}\frac{1}{p}$. The Partial Summation formula applied to this, using our result to say $A(x)=\log\log(x)+O(1)$, says
      $$
      \pi(x)-\pi(y) = x\log\log(x)-y\log\log(y)-\int_y^x \log\log(t)dt + O(x-y)
      $$
        This integral is equal to
        $$
        \int_y^x \log\log(t)dt = x\log\log(x)-y\log\log(y) +Li(y)-Li(x)
        $$
        Fixing $y$ at any value will allow us to eat up each of the terms that contain a $y$ into the big-O and so we can say that
        $$
        \pi(x) = Li(x) + O(x) 
        $$
