    <p>What are the integer solutions to the equation $x^y=y^x$? What about rational solutions? What about real solutions? Clearly we always have a solution when $x=y$, but what about when $x\ne y$? This is a fun little equation to solve and analyze. 
    </p>
    <p> Lets first classify all the real solutions, as this will help us find solutions in other number systems. Firstly, if we log both sides of the equation $a^b=b^a$ and rearrange things a bit, we get
    $$
    \frac{log(a)}{a}=\frac{\log(b)}{b}
    $$
    So if we set $f(x)=\log(x)/x$, then we'll have a solution to $a^b=b^a$ exactly when we have $f(a)=f(b)$, and happens when a horizontal line intersects the graph of our function at $x=a$ and $x=b$, so we should understand a bit about this graph. Note that $f(x)$ is a continuous and differentiable function for all $x>0$. Its derivative is 
    $$
    f'(x)= \frac{1-\log(x)}{x^2}
    $$
    And since the denominator is always nonzero in this domain, we get one critical point at $x=e$. Moreover, since the denominator is always positive, and $\log(x)<1$ when $x<e$ and $\log(x)>1$ when $x>e$, it follows that $x=e$ is a local maxima, and the funciton increases on the interval $(0,e)$ and decreases on the interval $(e,\infty)$. So, in fact, $x=e$ is the global maxima as well.  Moreover, the value of this maximum is $f(e)=1/e$. In fact, we have that $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^+}f(x)=-\infty$ and $\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}=0$.
    </p>
    <p>
    All of this means is that on the interval $(0,e)$, the function $f(x)$ strictly increases across the entire range $(-\infty,1/e)$ and on the interval $(e,\infty)$, the it strictly decreases across the entire range $(0,1/e)$. It should also be noted that $f(1)=0$. We can see this as the red graph here:

    <p>
    So when can we draw a horizontal line that intersects this graph at two differnt places? The above shows that this can happen exactly for pairs $a$ and $b$ when one of them is in the interval $(1,e)$ and the other is in the interval $(e,\infty)$. So there are infinitely many solutions to this, one for each number in the interval $(1,e)$.
    </p>
    <p>
    Therefore, we know that there are tons of solutions. Right away, we can show that $a=2$, $b=4$ is the only integer solution. This is because there is only one integer in the range $(1,e)$, and that integer is $2$, and since $2^4=4^2$, it follows that $a=2$ and $b=4$ is an integer solution and that there are no other possibilities.
     </p>
     <p>
     But to find what all the rational solutions are, we'll need to classify these solutions in a more maliable way.
