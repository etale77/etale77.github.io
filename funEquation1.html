    <p>What are the integer solutions to the equation $x^y=y^x$? What about rational solutions? What about real solutions? Clearly we always have a solution when $x=y$, but what about when $x\ne y$? This is a fun little equation to solve and analyze. 
    </p>
    <p> Lets first classify all the real solutions, as this will help us find solutions in other number systems. Firstly, if we log both sides of the equation $a^b=b^a$ and rearrange things a bit, we get
    $$
    \frac{\log(a)}{a}=\frac{\log(b)}{b}
    $$
    So if we set $f(x)=\log(x)/x$, then we'll have a solution to $a^b=b^a$ exactly when we have $f(a)=f(b)$, and happens when a horizontal line intersects the graph of our function at $x=a$ and $x=b$, so we should understand a bit about this graph. Note that $f(x)$ is a continuous and differentiable function for all $x>0$. Its derivative is 
    $$
    f'(x)= \frac{1-\log(x)}{x^2}
    $$
    And since the denominator is always nonzero in this domain, we get one critical point at $x=e$. Moreover, since the denominator is always positive, and $\log(x) &lt; 1$ when $x &lt; e$ and $\log(x)>1$ when $x>e$, it follows that $x=e$ is a local maxima, and the funciton increases on the interval $(0,e)$ and decreases on the interval $(e,\infty)$. So, in fact, $x=e$ is the global maxima as well.  Moreover, the value of this maximum is $f(e)=1/e$. In fact, we have that $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^+}f(x)=-\infty$ and $\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}=0$.
    </p>
    <p>
    All of this means is that on the interval $(0,e)$, the function $f(x)$ strictly increases across the entire range $(-\infty,1/e)$ and on the interval $(e,\infty)$, the it strictly decreases across the entire range $(0,1/e)$. It should also be noted that $f(1)=0$. We can see this as the red graph here:

    <p>
    So when can we draw a horizontal line that intersects this graph at two differnt places? The above shows that this can happen exactly for pairs $a$ and $b$ when one of them is in the interval $(1,e)$ and the other is in the interval $(e,\infty)$. So there are infinitely many solutions to this, one for each number in the interval $(1,e)$.
    </p>
    <p>
    Therefore, we know that there are tons of solutions. Right away, we can show that $a=2$, $b=4$ is the only integer solution. This is because there is only one integer in the range $(1,e)$, and that integer is $2$, and since $2^4=4^2$, it follows that $a=2$ and $b=4$ is an integer solution and that there are no other possibilities.
     </p>
     <p>
     But to find what all the rational solutions are, we'll need to classify these solutions in a more maliable way. In particular, if $a$ is an arbitrary number in the interval $(1,e)$, then what does the corresponding $b$ look like? If we set $r=\log_a(b)$, then we'll have $b=a^r$. Are $a$ and $b$ individually dependent on $r$? If we plug in $b=a^r$ into $\log(a)/a=\log(b)/b$, then we get
       $$
       \frac{\log(a)}{a}=\frac{r\log(a)}{a^r}
       $$
     which means that $r=a^{r-1}$, or $a=r^{1/(r-1)}$ and so $b=r^{r/(r-1)}$. This tells us how to recover $a$ and $b$ individually from a given $r$ so that $b=a^r$ is a solution to $a^b=b^a$. Of note is that any $a$ in the interval $(1,e)$ can be written as $a=r^{1/(r-1)}$ for some unique $r>1$. Moreover, given any $r>1$ we get that $r^{1/(r-1)}$ is in the interval $(1,e)$. This means that the real numbers $r>1$ uniquely parameterize the solutions to $a^b=b^a$ through
       $$
       \begin{eqnarray*}
       a & = & r^{1/(r-1)}\\
       b & = & r^{r/(r-1)}
       \end{eqnarray*}
       $$
    This completely characterizes all solutions to the equation $x^y=y^x$.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what about the rational solutions? When is both $a=r^{1/(r-1)}$ and $b=r^{r/(r-1)}$ rational numbers? Recall that we have $a=b^r$, so if $a$ and $b$ are both rational, then so is $r$. This is because One thing preventing these from being rational is the fraction in the exponent. If we impose that $\frac{1}{r-1}=n$ is an integer, then we find that $r=1+1/n$. In this canse $\frac{r}{1-r}=n+1$ is also an integer. So if $n$ is any positive integer and we set $r=1+1/n$ then we get the pair
       $$
       \begin{eqnarray*}
       a & = & \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n}\\
       b & = & \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n+1}
       \end{eqnarray*}
       $$
      which satisfies $a^b=b^a$. These are the values you get when you put $r=1+\frac{1}{n}$. Note that when $n=1$ we get $a=2$ and $b=4$. These are also the value of $r$ required so that the exponents, $\frac{1}{r-1}$ and $\frac{r}{r-1}$, are simultaneously integers.
