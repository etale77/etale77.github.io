  When talking about exponentiation, especially over the real numbers, you cannot escape the number $e$. It pops up everywhere, and in this post we're going to explore why and find some fundamental relationships involving $e$, the exponential function and logarithms.
  <h3>Exponents, derivatives and defining $e$</h3>
  <p>
  If $A$ is a positive real number, then we can consider the function $f(x)=A^x$ defined on the whole real line. This is a continuous function and is, in fact, differentiable.

  <h3>The Infinitesimal Additive Property</h3>
  <p>
  If $A$ is a positive real number, then we can consider the function $f(x)=A^x$ defined on the whole real line. This obeys the fundamental rule $A^{x+y}=A^xA^y$, which translates as $f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)$ for the function. This property is what makes exponents important, interesting and useful. But this is an arithmetic property of an exponential function, we would like to translate it into a calculus-based property.
